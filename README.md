# Procedural Generation + Soft-Shadow

This project, developed for my computer graphics course, employs procedural generation to create a 3D city environment using shadow mapping to render shadows. Additionally, percentage-closer filtering (PCF) is used to soften the edges of the shadows and prevent jaggies.
